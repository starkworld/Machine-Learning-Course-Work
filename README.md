# Machine-Learning-Course-Work
Consist of ML and data science code templates and course work
These are the assignment and coursework which I have done while I was taking Machine Learning course online.
### This Repo includes
* Data Preprocessing
### SuperVised Learning Methods
#### Regression models
* Linear Regression
** Linear Regression is a machine learning algorithm based on supervised learning.
It performs a regression task. Regression models a target prediction value based on independent variables.
It is mostly used for finding out the relationship between variables and forecasting.
Different regression models differ based on – the kind of relationship between dependent
and independent variables, they are considering and the number of independent variables being used.

* While training the model we are given :
* x: input training data (univariate – one input variable(parameter))
* y: labels to data (supervised learning)

* When training the model – it fits the best line to predict the value of y for a given value of x. The model gets the best regression fit line by finding the best θ1 and θ2 values.
* θ1: intercept
* θ2: coefficient of x

* Polynomial Regression
* Multiple Linear Regression
* Support Vector Machine Regression
* Decison Tree Regression
* Random Forest Regression
#### Classinfication models
* Logistic Regression
* Support Vector Machine Classification
* Naive Bayes
* Random Forest Classification
* Kernal Support Vector Machine
* Decision Tree Classification
* K-Nearest Neighbors
### Unsupervised Learning Methods
#### Clustering Models
* K means Clustering
* Hierarchical Clustering
### Reinforcement learning(Little)
* Association Rule based Learning
* Upper Confidence Bound
* Thompson Sampling

This Reo consist assignments of every model that written above.
